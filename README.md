# Tools for using the SDMDL Python package
This GitHub repository contains several handy Python tools for handling
in and outputs of the [SDMDL Python package](https://github.com/naturalis/sdmdl).
These scripts were created to facilitate the research on the effects of the addition of biotic interactions
into a deep learning species distribution model.

The raw and uninterpreted outputs and results of these case studies can be
requested from us. The data will then become available on our [Zenodo]() page.

Scripts are sorted into the following sub-folders:

* Data Preprocessing
+ Model Running
- Result Interpretation
